Translation credits
###################

I keep a copy of all translations in this repository so that it's easy
to host translations on the Beautiful Soup website. These are
generally not the canonical versions of the translations, though.

doc.jp/index.html is a copy of the 2013 Japanese translation hosted at
http://kondou.com/BS4/. Translation credit goes to "shige".

doc.ko/index.html is a copy of the 2012 Korean translation formerly hosted
at http://coreapython.hosting.paran.com/etc/beautifulsoup4.html. I
retrieved this copy from the Wayback Machine. I'm not sure who wrote
the translation but I believe the credit goes to "Johnsonj".

doc.ptbr/source/index.rst is a 2019 Brazilian Portuguese translation by Cezar
Peixeiro. The version in this repository has been modified from
https://github.com/czrpxr/BeautifulSoup4-ptbr-translation.

doc.zh/source/index.rst is a 2018 Chinese translation by Deron
Wang. The version in this repository has been modified from
https://github.com/DeronW/beautifulsoup.
